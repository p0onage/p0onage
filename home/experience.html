                            During my employment with TLA, I was primarily a backend-focused .Net developer supporting anything from IAC/CI-CD using Terraform/YAML Pipelines to writing all the microservices in .Net that our platform runs on while focusing on security aspects of the systems along the way. As part of a new product initiative, I was brought into a squad of four developers initially, with the exciting task of creating and migrating to a new platform. With a great product mindset, the business transitioned to a better system in order to stay competitive and drive the company forward in the direction it needed to go. This meant the ability for more innovative features, faster onboarding of integrations, and an increase in lead contact time due to the speed of the new lead generation platform. I enthusiastically assisted in the development and migration of the monolithic legacy platform, which was tightly coupled into the business, written with a Winforms UI, .Net Web APIs, windows services, and on-premise databases to a more decoupled, dynamic event-sourcing cloud-based architecture allowing the best industry practices in the latest versions of .Net. We continued to build out the Microservices to use .NET versions ranging from .NET 4.7 to .Net 7, and these services were primarily written in C# using a TDD approach. The platform is developed using an event-sourcing architecture following the CQRS pattern with Eventstore being the central hub of our events. The platform is hosted in Azure on serverless architecture to help scalability and reduce costs. Towards the end of my career at TLA, I worked more closely with junior members of staff to help build their knowledge of the platform, scope out technical tasks and help keep a coding standard across teams. Being the longest-reigning developer on this system usually meant I was the key contact for knowledge around the ever-growing platform.

                            On top of my full-time employment at TLA, I contracted myself out for at least one day a week to independently build out a new React-based application with a serverless backend API to allow engineers to capture data, location, signatures, and photo evidence of the welding done at various sites across the UK. The data was captured and forwarded to various clients through email and the data was backed up using Azure blob storage to allow engineers to re-access the data and pick up where they left off if they were halfway through a job.

                            As part of Scan Computer's small development team, our focus as full-stack software developers was on scalability, site speed, and facilitating the shift from a monolithic/legacy codebase to newer architecture and technologies that suited the business needs. We maintained both greenfield and legacy business-critical systems as well as being innovative and bringing new software solutions to the business to help serve our customer base better. Exposure to an e-commerce business has given me valuable insight into how software development operates and is applied in different industries. Projects varied under agile development practices and I contributed and developed many features including web crawling for price comparison software, image-capturing software for PC build stations stored in Azure Blob Storage, custom status screens built in Angular, multiple RESTful services, ETL Data importers, third-party SMS integration, administrative software, and Qlikview reports for KPI and sales information. Over the years, I supported key features across Scan's commercial operation using ASP.Net MVC and gained experience with database-driven functionality across the e-commerce website.

                            Halfords was my first job at 16 and a part time earner for me while I was studying throughout college and university. I was apart of the BikeHut sales team multi-tasking between sales assistant, bike repairs and bike building. Due to my thirst for knowledge I soon expanded to other departments and started to train up in fitting child seats, wiper blades, roof racks, licence plates, radios, bulbs and batteries. I found a particular interest in driving KPI's and hitting sale targets. Managing and training junior members of staff. Travelling to different stores to help with stock checks and often the first one to step forward for overtime to support the business especially near Christmas.
